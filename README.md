Set up the database.
Step 1:Use the cd command to make the Postgres Plus bin directory your current
working directory.
cd C:\Program Files\PostgresPlus\8.4SS\bin
Note: If you are using Postgres Plus Advanced Server, use the cd command to make
dbserver\bin your current working directory.
Step 2: Run the psql program with the name of a database to which a connection is to
be established (-d option), a role name that has the superuser privilege (-U option), and
the directory path to the backup file (-f option).
Note: The database you specify with the -d option is not affected by the restore
operation. The psql program requires a session to be established over a database
connection before it can process the SQL statements and psql commands from the
backup file.
